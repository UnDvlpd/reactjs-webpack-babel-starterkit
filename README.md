# ReactJS + Webpack + Babel starterkit

Starter kit used to build
[Netwalk game using ReactJS](https://github.com/sergeylukin/netwalk-reactjs)
for my course on ReactJS (to be released on https://code4startup.com)

## Why?

Cause it's freaking awesome when code changes are applied on the fly while you
change the app state (oh yeah, you heard just right, no page reloads, JS/CSS/HTML
code changes are injected silently, pretty amazing stuff) and that's what you
can easily achieve with ReactJS + Webpack. And if we are already so bold, why
not writing in ES2015 instead of ES5? So we bundle `Babel` here too, a ES6 to
ES5 transpiler that is so pipes-friendly that it has a pipeable ReactJS JSX
syntax transform plugin which allows you to write code in the future today :)
Enjoy!

## Getting started

- Clone this project

- Make sure you have NodeJS installed. More details on [NodeJS official
  website](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Run `npm install` to install all the development tools and project dependencies

- Run `npm start` to get ball rolling and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
(or if you want to see better error reports and see the status panel
visit
[http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/bundle](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/bundle)
instead)

- Build you web app/game of dream :)
